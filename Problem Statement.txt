Company X is a local telecom company and is facing a decline in profits over the past few years. BCG has been engaged to drive improvements in profitability. One of the hypotheses under consideration is the introduction of handset leasing. 

Handset leasing works by renting new phones to customers for a monthly fee instead of selling phones to customers at a discounted upfront cost. Customers lease phones for a fixed term (usually 12 months), before they swap their used phone for a new model. Some telecom companies bundle phone leasing plans with lower-priced sim only mobile plans. This allows customers to change their phones more frequently without incurring upfront costs of buying phones through retail, or affecting their mobile plans. For the telcos, this reduces their need to hold inventory, and reduces their financing costs, both of which can help profitability.
